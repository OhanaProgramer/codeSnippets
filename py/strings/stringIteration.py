"""
Explanation:
This program demonstrates how to iterate over each character in a string using a for loop.
It assigns a string value to a variable and then loops through each character, printing each one.
This is useful for situations where you need to process or analyze each character individually.
"""
#Declare a string variable
string = "Hello!"

#Iterate through each character in the string
for char in string:
    print(f'Character: {char}')

#Output:
# Character: H
# Character: e
# Character: l
# Character: l
# Character: o
# Character: !

# The loop iterates through each character in the string and prints it out.
# This can be useful for processing or analyzing each character individually.
