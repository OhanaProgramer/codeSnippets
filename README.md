# Code Snippets Repository

## Overview
Welcome to the Code Snippets repository! This project is designed as a comprehensive learning library for programming concepts in **C++** and **Python**. The repository contains a wide range of example programs covering basic to intermediate topics such as branching, loops, data types, and other common coding patterns.

The goal of this repository is to serve as a handy reference for those preparing for exams, interviews, or simply looking to strengthen their understanding of core programming concepts. For each topic, equivalent examples are provided in both **C++** and **Python** to help you learn how to implement the same logic in different languages.

# How to Use This Repository
--Beginner Programmers:-- Start with basic examples in the branches and loops folders. These contain fundamental control flow constructs that are essential to understand for all programming languages.
Comparison Learning: Compare the C++ and Python versions of the same concept to understand how language syntax differs while the logic remains similar.
Interview Prep: Review the examples to practice and strengthen your understanding of common programming patterns.
